# RIALTO Scripts

This repo contains scripts to produce custom research intelligence reporting.

Documentation for the scripts is often inline in the code.

Current Ruby scripts:
1. `faculty_wos_search.rb` - provide a list of faculty member names, search for their publications in WoS, 
enumerate co-authors by country and/or organization, output a CSV file

2. `total_wos_search.rb` - search for publications at Stanford by year between provided year range,
output a CSV file showing total publications for each year
